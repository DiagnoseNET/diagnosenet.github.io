	<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> DiagnoseNET </span> is an open source framework
		for tailoring deep neural networks into different computational architectures
		from CPU-GPU implementation to multi-GPU and multi-nodes with an efficient ratio
		between accuracy and energy consumption.
		It is oriented to propose a green intelligence medical workflow
		for deploying medical diagnostic tools inside the hospitals
		with minimal infrastructure requirements and low power consumption. </p>

	<p> The first application built was to automate the
		<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-16205-4_1">
			unsupervised patient phenotype representation workflow</a>
		trained on a mini-cluster of Nvidia Jetson TX2. This workflow was divided into three stages:

	<ol>
		<li>The first stage mining electronic health records for patient feature extraction
			and serialised each patient record in a clinical document architecture schema to create
			a binary patient representation.</li>
		<li>The second stage embedding the patient’s binary matrix via an unsupervised learning
			to obtain a new latent space and identify the patient’s phenotypic representations.</li>
		<li>The last stage focuses on supervised learning using the patient's features
			(binary or latent representation) as an input for machine learning algorithms
			or as an initialiser for deep neural networks.</li>
	</ol>
