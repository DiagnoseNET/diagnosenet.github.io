  	<h2>DiagnoseNET Modules</h2> 
	
  	<p>The first module is the deep learning model graph generator, which has two expression languages:
		a $sequentialGraph$ API designed to automatize the hyperparameter search and
		a $customGraph$ which support the TensorFlow expression codes for sophisticated neural networks. 
		The second module is the data manager compose by three classes designed for splitting,
		batching and multi-task any dataset over diverse computational architecture systems. 
		The third is the platform execution module create to automatize the different parallel methods
		for training the neural networks over the platforms.
		The fourth module extends the enerGyPU monitor for workload characterization, constitute by
		a data capture in runtime to collect the convergence tracking logs and the computing factor metrics;
		and a dashboard for the experimental analysis results.
